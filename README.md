# SOILWAT2

This version of SoilWat brings new features. This is the same
code that is used by [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2) and
[STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2).

If you make use of this model, please cite appropriate references, and we would like to
hear about your particular study (especially a copy of any published paper).

## How to contribute
You can help us in different ways:

1. Reporting [issues](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/issues)
2. Contributing code and sending a [pull request](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/pulls)

__SOILWAT2 code is used as part of three applications__: stand-alone, as part of [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2),
and as part of the R package [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2)
* The files 'Makevars', 'SW_R_lib.c' and 'SW_R_lib.h' are used when compiling for
  [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2) and ignored otherwise.
* The file 'SW_Main_Function.c' is used when compiling with
  [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2) and ignored otherwise.

__Follow our guidelines__ as detailed [here](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/workflow_guidelines)

__Tests, documentation, and code__ form a trinity
- Code documentation
  * Use [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to write inline code documentation
  * Update help pages on the command-line with `doxygen Doxyfile`
- Code tests
  * Use [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/Documentation.md)
  to add unit tests to the existing framework
  * Run unit tests locally on the command-line with
    ```
    make test     # compiles the unit-test binary/executable
    make test_run # executes the unit-test binary
    make cleaner
    ```
  * Development/feature branches can only be merged into master if they pass all checks
