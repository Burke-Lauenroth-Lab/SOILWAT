# SOILWAT2

This version of SoilWat brings new features. This is the same
code that is used by [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/rSOILWAT2) and
[STEPWAT2](https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/STEPWAT2).

If you make use of this model, please cite appropriate references, and we would like to
hear about your particular study (especially a copy of any published paper).
