# SOILWAT2

This version of SoilWat brings new features. This is the same
code that is used by [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2)
and [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2).

If you make use of this model, please cite appropriate references, and we would
like to hear about your particular study (especially a copy of any published
paper).

## How to contribute
You can help us in different ways:

1. Reporting [issues](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/issues)
2. Contributing code and sending a
   [pull request](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/pulls)


__Compilation__:
  * Requirements:
    - the `gcc` or `clang/llvm` toolchains
      - `gcc >= v4.9` and `clang >= v3.3` for the `*_severe` test/debug targets
    - POSIX- or GNU-compliant `make`
    - On Windows OS: an installation of `cygwin`
  * Build with `make` (see `make help` to print information about all
    available targets)


__SOILWAT2 code is used as part of three applications__:
  * stand-alone (code flag `SOILWAT` is defined if neither `STEPWAT` nor
    `RSOILWAT` exist),
  * as part of [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2)
    (code flag `STEPWAT`), and
  * as part of the R package
    [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2)
    (code flag `RSOILWAT`)


__Follow our guidelines__ as detailed
[here](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/workflow_guidelines)

__Tests, documentation, and code__ form a trinity
- Code documentation
  * Use [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to write inline code
    documentation
  * Update help pages (locally) on the command-line with `doxygen Doxyfile`,
    but don't push them to the repository
- Code tests
  * Use [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/Documentation.md)
    to add unit tests to the existing framework in the folder `test/` where
    each unit test file uses the naming scheme `test/test_*.cc`.
  * Note: `SOILWAT2` is written in C whereas `GoogleTest` is a C++ framework.
  * Run unit tests locally on the command-line with
    ```
    make test test_run         # compiles and executes the unit-tests
    make test_severe test_run  # compiles/executes with strict/severe flags
    make clean                 # cleans build artifacts
    ```
  * If you want to run unit tests repeatedly (e.g., to sample a range of
    random numbers), then you may use the bash-script `many_test_runs.sh` which
    runs `N` number of times and reports only unit test failures, e.g.,
    ```
    ./many_test_runs.sh # will run a default (currently, 10) number of times
    N=3 ./many_test_runs.sh # will run 3 replicates
    ```
  * Development/feature branches can only be merged into master if they pass
    all checks on `appveyor` and `travis` continuous integration servers, i.e.,
    run the following locally to prepare a pull-request or commit to be reviewed
    ```
    make clean bin_debug_severe bint_run
    make clean test_severe test_run
    ```
  * Note that you may want/need to exclude known memory leaks from severe
    testing (see https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/issues/205):
    ```
    ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=.LSAN_suppr.txt make clean test_severe test_run
    ```

    The address sanitizer may not work correctly and/or fail, if you use the
    `Apple-clang` version shipped with macOS X. You may need to build `clang`
    yourself
    (see [Sanitizer issue #1026](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1026)):
    e.g.,
    ```
    sudo port install clang-8.0 clang-select
    sudo port select --set clang mp-clang-8.0
    ```
    and to revert to the default version
    ```
    sudo port select --set clang none
    ```
    If you installed `clang` in a non-default location, then you
    may need to also fix names of shared dynamic libraries in the test
    executable if you get the error `... dyld: Library not loaded ...`, e.g.,
    ```
    # build test executable with clang and leak detection
    CC=clang CXX=clang++ ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=.LSAN_suppr.txt make clean test_severe
    otool -L sw_test # check faulty library path
    # figure out correct library path and insert with:
    install_name_tool -change /opt/local/libexec/llvm-8.0/lib/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib /opt/local/libexec/llvm-8.0/lib/clang/8.0.0/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib sw_test
    # run tests
    make test_run
    ```

  * Informal and local integration tests example:
    1. Before coding, run `testing/` and produce reference output
        ```
        git checkout master
        make bin bint_run
        cp -r testing/Output testing/Output_ref
        ```
    2. Develop your code and keep "testing/Output_ref" locally, i.e., don't
    include "testing/Output_ref" in commits
    3. Regularly, e.g., before finalizing a commit, check that new code produces
    identical output (that is unless you work on output...)
        ```
        make bin bint_run
        diff testing/Output/ testing/Output_ref/ -qs
        ```

- Debugging is controlled at two levels:
  * at the preprocessor (pass `-DSWDEBUG`):
    all debug code is wrapped by this flag so that it does not end up in
    production code; unit testing is compiled in debugging mode.
  * in functions with local debug variable flags (int debug = 1;):
    debug code can be conditional on such a variable, e.g.,
    ```
    void foo() {
      #ifdef SWDEBUG
      int debug = 1;
      #endif
      ...
      #ifdef SWDEBUG
      if (debug) swprintf("hello, this is debugging code\n");
      ...
      #endif
      ...
    }
    ```
  * Clean, compile and run optimized SOILWAT2-standalone in debugging mode
    with, e.g.,
    ```
    make bin bint_run CPPFLAGS=-DSWDEBUG
    ```
  * Alternatively and potentially preferably, you can use the pre-configured
    debugging targets
    `bin_debug` and `bin_debug_severe`, for instance, with
    ```
    make bin_debug_severe bint_run
    ```
  * If **valgrind** is installed, then you can call the target `bind_valgrind`
    (see description in `makefile`) with
    ```
    make bind_valgrind
    ```
