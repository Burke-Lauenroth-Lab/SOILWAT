# SOILWAT2

This version of SoilWat brings new features. This is the same
code that is used by [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2)
and [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2).

If you make use of this model, please cite appropriate references, and we would
like to hear about your particular study (especially a copy of any published
paper).

## How to contribute
You can help us in different ways:

1. Reporting [issues](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/issues)
2. Contributing code and sending a
   [pull request](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2/pulls)


__SOILWAT2 code is used as part of three applications__:
  * stand-alone (code flag `SOILWAT` is defined if neither `STEPWAT` nor
    `RSOILWAT` exist),
  * as part of [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2)
    (code flag `STEPWAT`), and
  * as part of the R package
    [rSOILWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2)
    (code flag `RSOILWAT`)


__Follow our guidelines__ as detailed
[here](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/workflow_guidelines)

__Tests, documentation, and code__ form a trinity
- Code documentation
  * Use [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to write inline code
    documentation
  * Update help pages (locally) on the command-line with `doxygen Doxyfile`,
    but don't push them to the repository
- Code tests
  * Use [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/Documentation.md)
    to add unit tests to the existing framework
  * Run unit tests locally on the command-line with
    ```
    make test     # compiles the unit-test binary/executable (with `-DSWDEBUG`)
    make test_run # executes the unit-test binary
    make cleaner
    ```
  * Development/feature branches can only be merged into master if they pass
    all checks
  * Informal and local integration tests example:
    1. Before coding, run `testing/` and produce reference output
        ```
        git checkout master
        make cleaner bint_run
        cp -r testing/Output testing/Output_ref
        ```
    2. Develop your code and keep "testing/Output_ref" locally, i.e., don't
    include "testing/Output_ref" in commits
    3. Regularly, e.g., before finalizing a commit, check that new code produces
    identical output (that is unless you work on output...)
        ```
        make cleaner bint_run
        diff testing/Output/ testing/Output_ref/ -qs
        ```

- Debugging is controlled at two levels:
  * at the preprocessor (pass `-DSWDEBUG`):
    all debug code is wrapped by this flag so that it does not end up in
    production code; unit testing is compiled in debugging mode.
  * in functions with local debug variable flags (int debug = 1;):
    debug code can be conditional on such a variable, e.g.,
    ```
    void foo() {
      #ifdef SWDEBUG
      int debug = 1;
      #endif
      ...
      #ifdef SWDEBUG
      if (debug) swprintf("hello, this is debugging code\n");
      ...
      #endif
      ...
    }
    ```
  * Clean, compile and run SOILWAT2-standalone in debugging mode with, e.g.,
    ```
    make cleaner bint_run CPPFLAGS=-DSWDEBUG
    ```
  * The "makefile" also contains pre-configured debugging targets including
    `bin_debug`, `bind`, and `bind_valgrind` (see description in `makefile`).
    If **valgrind** is installed, then for example
    ```
    make cleaner bind_valgrind
    ```
